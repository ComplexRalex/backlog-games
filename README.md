# Backlog Games

## Hey

Just as a reminder... in order to use this app, you'll need a backend. I implemented a "GameCollectionRepo" with PocketBase, so I recommend you to use it.

I exported a JSON file with the only collection defined in this app: games.

## Disclaimer

I did this project with NextJS 12. However, the implementation is not following the *best practices* of the framework. That's why I consider this as a "ReactJS project" instead.

It's very possible that there are many and better implementations out there on the internet, so you should check them out.

On the whole, this app is a combination of a bunch of ideas and implementations using clean architecture.
